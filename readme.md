## Frontend Mentor Challenge Repository

This repository is a collection of frontend challenges from Frontend Mentor. Frontend Mentor is a platform that offers various web development challenges to improve and showcase your frontend skills. All the code for each page is located in the "website" folder. I've used Tailwind CSS to build all the pages.
